# Computer Vision

* `Assignment 1`: Consider two architectures `LeNet-5` and a `traditional neural network`
    * dataset: handwritten `MNIST`
    * compare the architectures based on:
        * precision
        * recall
        * time taken for training process

* `Assignment 2`: Design Siamese architecture to find the similarity between two biometric images

* `U-Net architecture`: Design a U-Net architecture for image segmentation

* `Alex-Net architecture`: Design an Alex-Net architecture
