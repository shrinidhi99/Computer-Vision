# Computer Vision

* [`Assignment 1`](Assignment-1): Consider two architectures `LeNet-5` and a `traditional neural network`
    * dataset: handwritten `MNIST`
    * compare the architectures based on:
        * precision
        * recall
        * time taken for training process

* [`Assignment 2`](Assignment-2): Design Siamese architecture to find the similarity between two biometric images

* [`U-Net architecture`](U-Net): Design a U-Net architecture for image segmentation

* [`Alex-Net architecture`](Alex-Net): Design an Alex-Net architecture

* [`Autoencoders`](Autoencoders): Design an autoencoder to encode and decode an image
